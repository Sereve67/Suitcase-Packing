# Suitcase Packing Application

## Overview
This project is a suitcase packing application that implements the 0/1 Knapsack problem. Users can input items with their weights and quantities, specify the suitcase's weight capacity, and visualize how the items can be packed into the suitcase.

## Files
- **templates/index.html**: The main HTML document for the suitcase packing application. It includes input fields for suitcase capacity and items, a table to display items, and a section for visualizing the packed items. It also contains JavaScript functions to handle item addition, submission, and visualization of packing.

- **templates/visualizePacking.html**: A separate visual representation of the packing process. This file includes its own HTML structure and JavaScript to visualize the packed items differently, potentially using different styles or animations compared to the main index.html.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the suitcase packing application.
2. Enter the suitcase capacity and add items with their respective weights and quantities.
3. Click the "Pack Suitcase" button to visualize how the items can be packed.
4. For an alternative visualization, open `visualizePacking.html`.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.
- Basic understanding of how to interact with web forms.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional algorithms for packing optimization.
- Enhance the visual representation in `visualizePacking.html` with more interactive elements.
- Add user authentication for saving packing sessions.
