# Suitcase-Packing
This project uses 0/1 Knapsack DP to optimize suitcase packing based on item weight and value. A Flask API takes user input and selects items for maximum value within the suitcase capacity. The interactive UI visually stacks packed items, showing used/available space dynamically.
